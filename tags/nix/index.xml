across my devices without having to use a proprietary tool like &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox&lt;/a>. You
can use this tool on almost any system, and I definitely would recommend it to
anyone who wants to sync files across their devices due to its ease of use and
security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
This post doesn&amp;#39;t go over how you would use Syncthing normally as you would on any
other distro, instead showing off how nix can be used to manage Syncthing. Which
can be especially great when you need to manage a lot of devices or folders. If you
want a standard guide I would recommend Syncthing&amp;#39;s great &lt;a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html">guide&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/">documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simple Restic Backups on Nixos</title><link>https://imranmustafa.net/simple-restic-backup-on-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 16:32:42 -0500</pubDate><author>imran@imranmustafa.net (Imran Mustafa)</author><guid>https://imranmustafa.net/simple-restic-backup-on-nixos/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it comes to all the things that &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/">nix&lt;/a> lets you do, defining complex services
deterministically in text, is probably the most powerful. For example I have nix
manage all of my system backup jobs. Which could be handled with a shell
script, but can be so much more extensible when configured entirely within nix. I
hope showing off how I manage this can help you further understand what you can
do with nix, especially with configuring services.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
