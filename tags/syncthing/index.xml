across my devices without having to use a proprietary tool like &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox&lt;/a>. You
can use this tool on almost any system, and I definitely would recommend it to
anyone who wants to sync files across their devices due to its ease of use and
security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
This post doesn&amp;#39;t go over how you would use Syncthing normally as you would on any
other distro, instead showing off how nix can be used to manage Syncthing. Which
can be especially great when you need to manage a lot of devices or folders. If you
want a standard guide I would recommend Syncthing&amp;#39;s great &lt;a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html">guide&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/">documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
