you could get tons of new packages on the system in a stable way. Not even a
month later I found out about &lt;a href="https://distrobox.it/">Distrobox&lt;/a> which is a tool based around
containerization, allowing you to bring any package manager and package
repository to your distro of choice.&lt;/p>

Is Distrobox Right For You?

&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-3">
&lt;p>Distrobox is essentially a wrapper around a container engine. That creates
lightweight and highly transparent containers, bringing the user land of any
containerized Linux OS to your current system. This can do lots of great things
especially with development work, but another great use is an expansion to
what package managers you can use. This becomes even easier with Distrobox&amp;#39;s
ability to export binaries out of the containers and into your regular Linux
system. Making it even easier to install and manage programs not naively
available through your distro.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
